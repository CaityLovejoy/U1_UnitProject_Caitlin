Another attempt at a game 
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> It is meant to be a puzzle game where you solve puzzels so you can leave the room you are trapped in but i didnt get very far into making it <p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
<p> I was inspired by a game called "please dont touch anything", it is a puzzle game where you hit random buttons to try and find the game's secrets.<p>
<p> I wanted to do something similar but I wanted there to be a more definitive end goal. <p>
